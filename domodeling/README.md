# Domain Modeling in Golang type system
Design architecture to make:
- State management - easy
- Restricting programs - easy
- Scalability of teams and solutions - easy

Few inspirations:
> Parsing preserve information, validation don't.
- [Parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)

> taxonomies are useful for documenting a domain of interest, but not necessarily helpful for modeling it
> Primarily, types distinguish functional differences between values. A value of type NonEmpty a is functionally distinct from a value of type [a], since it is fundamentally structurally different and permits additional operations. In this sense, types are structural; they describe what values are in the internal world of the programming language.
> Secondarily, we sometimes use types to help ourselves avoid making logical mistakes. We might use separate Distance and Duration types to avoid accidentally doing something nonsensical like adding them together, even though theyâ€™re both representationally real numbers.
- [Names are not type sefty](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/)

> type system and checking is just a tool
- [Names are not type sefty](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/)

We shoudn't write code to limit ourself too much

Re use types across modules?
- To specific `type Some string` 
- GraphQL federation

```
// DATA in
POST /some-action
{"some":"input"}

// Framework handles
rq := ParseHTTP()
shape := ParseJSON(rq.Body)

// Essence
dom:=ParseDomain(shape)
int:=InterpretDomain()
res:=ExecuteDomain(dom,int)

// Framework
body = EncodeJSON(res)
SendHTTP(body)

// DATA out
HTTP 200
{success:}
```

More expand verions

```
// DATA in

POST /some-action
{"some":"input"}

// Framework handles
rq := ParseHTTP()
shape := ParseJSON(rq.Body)

// Essence

// value objects, available to other sub-domains? - or how to compose subdomains?
domain_tokens := Money | Dimension | 
domain_object := { primitive + domain_tokens + domain_object} 

dom:=ParseDomain(shape) DomObj {
    DomObj.<field> = ParseValueObject(shape.value)
}

int:=InterpretDomainA() {
    HandleCreateX() {
        // create other domain objects
        // invoke other interpreters? or execute other domain objects
        // expand or reduce domain execution
        // communicate with storage
        // - builds SQL (express change in domain language)
        // - maps back results
        // ---- storage layer like SQL parse everything once again and valdates integrity and constraings
        // 
        // Where is integrity constrains check in this model?
    }
}

res:=ExecuteDomainA(dom,int) 

// Framework

body = EncodeJSON(res)
SendHTTP(body)

// DATA out

HTTP 200
{success:}

```

### hoe example domain could look like?

   question
   - id : question_id
   - author: user_id
   - content: text

   answer
   - id: answer_id
   - author: user_id
   - question: question_id  
   - content: text

   comment
   - id:comment_id
   - author: user_id
   - content: text
   - created|updated|deleted : date

   ref_has_comment
   - object_ref: question_id | answer_id
   - comment_ref: comment_id

-- view requirements

   question_feed_view: {filter_by: [user_id, number_of_answers], sort_by: [created_at]}
   - question_ref: question_id
   - question_author_ref: user_id
   - question_created: date
   - number_of_answers: int
   - number_of_question_comments: int
   - number_of_answer_comments: int

   how to keep it with sync?
   - optimistic UI
   - streaming, CDCs
   
   how to make it fast, without overcomplicated state management?
   - materialise views - requires batch updates - eventual consistency
   - projections re-building with streaming, CDCs, event sourcing, outbox pattern + events - eventual consistency
   - HTAP databases - eventual consistency
   
   how to make it?
   - joins - via SQL
   - aggregations on API Gateway like GraphQL for simplere 1:1 aggregates can be faster
   - backend for frontend with their own state management - write through back-end for frontend?
 
## how to structure team ownership and independence in monorepo?

- soft delete is interesting decision
  do we really need to validate whenever question exits when posting comment? 
  imagine that we now try to separate part of the system and `comment.add` requires do remote API call, no longer is part of DB
  imagine that we approach external communication and internal communication in the same way, 
  What we loose?
  - transactionality that database gives us, now we have to have process manager, transaction mangers, sagas,..
  - aggregation of data now requires writing JOIN, GROUP BY instead of using them
  What we gain?
  - isolation, independence

- `use case` is concept of transactionality, unit of work that accepted must happen or be rejected.
    - read and write
    - composition of few `source-of-truth`
    - for transactionality can use process manager, sagas
    - offers eventual consistency 
- `source-of-truth` also lower level of transactionality.
    - read and write
    - closes to storage implementation
    - offers strong consistency
- `projection` concept of materialised views, aggregations, indexes
    - read only
    - offers eventual consistency

let's add as a new requirements points or other business constrain

let's take a look at ownership and types of team topologies that can be modeled in this structure of document


#### Feature separation of teams

```
  TEAM A
  (question ownership end to end)
  
  /src
    /use-cases
      /post-questions
      /moderate-questions
    /projections
      /question-feed
    /source-of-truth
      /questions

  TEAM B
  (comments ownership end to end)
  
  /src
    /use-cases
      /moderate-comment
      /autocomment-new-questions
      /post-comment
    /projections
      /comments-moderators-view
    /source-of-truth
      /comments
      
  INFRA TEAM A
  (core can be imported as dependecies)
  
  src/
    /catalog-of-capabilities
      /notifications
      /elasticearch
      /jobqueue

```

#### Separation by customer workflows

```
  TEAM A 
  (owns backoffice tool for moderator)
  
  /src
    /use-cases
      /moderate-questions
      /moderate-comment
    /projections
      /moderators-actions-view
      /moderators-actions-raport

      /comments-moderators-view
    /source-of-truth
      /moderator-actions
      /customer-helpdesk
      
  TEAM B
  (owns customers centric part)
  
  /src
    /use-cases
      /post-question
      /post-comment
    /projections
      /question-feed

Code generation at B for Î¼service is interesting productivity gain, but one step further is 
how can we then remove what engineers need to generate and maintain nad upload only business logic
and runtime we be updated and managed by other team?
